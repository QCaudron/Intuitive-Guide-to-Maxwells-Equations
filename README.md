## Description

This is a guide to Maxwell's equations which focuses on providing an intuitive / geometric review of some of the main concepts.

The main inspiration for this guide was a video by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) and it can be found here:

[Divergence and Curl: The language of Maxwell's equations, fluid flow, and more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB83DpBJQsE)

The images illustrating vector fields, as well as the concepts included in the curl and divergence sections were taken directly from the video. 

The images shown when explaining the heat equation and partial differential equations were also taken from the video series by 3Blue1Brown called ‘Solving the Heat Equation’ which can be found using the link below:

Also, by no means is this a thorough reference! For those wanting a more in depth view of the equations, I'd suggest taking a look at [A Student's Guide to Maxwell's Equations by Dan Fleisch](http://www.danfleisch.com/maxwell/), which not only goes into a much more detailed view of the equations, but also includes valuable examples and practice problems!

Many thanks to Grant Sanderson / 3Blue1Brown for the outstanding material he's made available on his channel, as well as for allowing me to use the images from his videos in presenting some of the topics available within the guide!
